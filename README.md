# IBM-AI-Engineering-Course-Projects
This repository contains the course projects that I completed as part of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate. The certificate consists of six courses that cover various topics in artificial intelligence, such as machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. The projects demonstrate my skills and knowledge in applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, NLTK, and other tools and frameworks. The repository is organized by course name and project title. Each project folder contains a Jupyter notebook with the code and a README file with a brief description of the project objectives, data sources, methods, results, and conclusions. The repository also includes a certificate folder with the PDF file of the certificate that I earned upon completing the course.
